Write a program that reads the lines from the file at this URL location, http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/data/manylinks.html, and prints each URL on the page that is a link to youtube.com. Assume that a link to youtube.com has no spaces in it and would be in the format (where [stuff] represents characters that are not verbatim): “http:[stuff]youtube.com[stuff]”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are suggestions to get started.

1. Create a new Java Class named Part4 in the StringsFirstAssignments project and put your code in that class.

2. Use URLResource to read the file at http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/data/manylinks.html word by word.

3. For each word, check to see if “youtube.com” is in it. If it is, find the double quote to the left and right of the occurrence of “youtube.com” to identify the beginning and end of the URL. Note, the double quotation mark is a special character in Java. To look for a double quote, look for (\”), since the backslash (\) character indicates we want the literal quotation marks (“) and not the Java character. The string you search for would be written “\”” for one double quotation mark.

4. In addition to the String method indexOf(x, num), you might want to consider using the String method lastIndexOf(s, num) that can be used with two parameters s and num. The parameter s is the string or character to look for, and num is the last position in the string to look for it. This method returns the last match from the start of the string up to the num position, so it is a good option for finding the opening quotation mark of a string searching backward from “youtube.com.” More information on String methods can be found in the Java documentation for Strings: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html.

The URLResource class opens a connection to a URL and allows access to the contents of the web page a line at a time, using the method lines, or a word at a time, using the method words. These strings can then be iterated over using a for loop.

This class provides methods for storing and accessing a list of strings of any length. Generally you will start by creating an empty StorageResource, then adding string values as you find them in a file or web page
