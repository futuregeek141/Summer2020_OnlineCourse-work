For genome scientists, String is genetic information stored as long list or string over the four letter alphabet, A,T,C,G and backbone phosphate.

Reading and detecting data from:
- Genomic data stored in fasta format - Programs to find proteins, genes
- Programs to find links and small info from webpage, like google
- Data from CSV file

Finding patterns.

Algorithms:
Working with strings that represent DNA,

Nucleotide(Amino acid) - Building blocks of DNA
Codon - 3 blocks together
Start codon(ATG) to stop codon(TAA) forms one gene
Real gene are multiples of 3 due to codons

String useful methods
s.length()
s.substring(4,7) asdghhf = hhf
s.indexOf("hhf") 4 //Solution for dna problem

Sample Algorithm made up to find gene from strand of DNA :
- method findgenesimple
- set resultGENE to null
- Locate start codon, ATG dna.indexOf("ATG")
- Locate stop codon, TAA dna.indexOf("TAA",(Index of ATG + 3)
- dna.substring(start,stop+3) assign to result
