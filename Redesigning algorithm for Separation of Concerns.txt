Something that can hold all genes: StorageResource by Duke
Works like traditional arraylist

This class provides methods for storing and accessing a list of strings of any length. Generally you will start by creating an empty StorageResource, then adding string values as you find them in a file or web page

sr.add("string")
sr.size
sr.contains(item)
sr.clears()
for (String data : sr.data())

The DirectoryResource class allows the user to choose one or more files from a directory (or folder) with a file selection dialog box by using the method selectedFiles. These files can then be iterated over using a for loop.
Example usage:

 DirectoryResource dr = new DirectoryResource();
 for (File f : dr.selectedFiles()) {
     ImageResource ir = new ImageResource(f);
     ir.draw();
 }

The FileResource class represents a file and allows access to its contents a line at a time, using the method lines, or a word at a time, using the method words. These strings can then be iterated over using a for loop.
Example usage:

 FileResource fr = new FileResource();
 for (String s : fr.words()) {
     // print or process s
 }
