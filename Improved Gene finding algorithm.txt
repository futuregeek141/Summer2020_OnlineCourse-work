Extended programming and problem solving capability:

Work  on genes using a model of start and stop codons, like genome and computational scientists for making personalized medicines and understanding genetic issues.

Using indefinte loop:
- Storing intermediate results
- Lets results processsed and filtered

Improvising algorithm:
- Find first occurrence of ATG
- Found TAA after the ATG
- Checking if distance between them is multiple of 3
- If not, find the next TAA
(This process can not be definite..)

For multiple stop codons like "TAA", "TAG", "TGA":
